## About the Video Course
This fully dynamic, step-by-step course teaches you how to use JavaScript to develop fun interactive applications from scratch. The source code is included to get you started quickly. Beginner-level JavaScript knowledge is required as the course covers only JavaScript that is relevant to the building of games. Also HTML and CSS knowledge is essential as the scope of this course is entirely JavaScript-focused. 
From scratch, you'll build five applications: a tip calculator, a custom welcome message, a dynamic user timed message, an Element sound player, and a dynamic typing tester application.
